Self directed applications of the principle's of the modules of the coursework. Include a sub branch for Dartmouth: C Programming: Using Linux Tools and Libraries
Sure! I'll create a README.md for your repository, integrating the subsections for both courses. Given the specificity and integration of your request with Gordon Graham's style, I'll do my best to emulate a detailed, value-driven description, though note that I'm not him. ;)

Guided by the principles of Gordon Graham's intricate detailing and the quest for knowledge, this repository presents a hands-on journey. As we delve deeper into these subjects, the line between learning and application blurs, creating a harmonious amalgamation of theory and practice.

This will be the Final Dartmouth C/Linux course of the certificate program (8 modules total, learned C throgh tis course almost 3 years ago and somehow forgot to finsih this last section) and the whole of CS50 becuaseI keep starting it, passing the first or first and second modules, and then getting busy or distracted and the course resets. This time it gets finished.
